# Understanding-Household-Privacy-and-Financial-Disparities
The **H8 variable** indicates whether all rooms in a household are exclusively accessible to its members. By examining correlations with **income levels**, this study uncovers links between privacy compromises and broader socioeconomic trends.  

📌 **Designed for recruiters**: This repository showcases expertise in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **statistical modeling in R**, and the ability to **communicate insights into social and financial inequalities**.

## 🔹 Project Highlights  

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Filtered continuous variables to study correlations with **income (INC)**  
- Built a **correlation matrix** to identify strong links between **H8 and household income**  

---

### 📊 Uni-variate & Ethnicity Analysis  
- Created barplots of **H8 distribution across ethnic groups**  
- Key finding: **H8 = 1 (shared rooms) occurs exclusively among Asian households**  

---

### ✂️ Subsetting & Hypothesis Testing  
- Subset dataset to isolate Asian households with **H8 = 1**  
- Compared **average household income** across groups:  
  - **H8 = 1 (Asian households):** $35,843  
  - **H8 = 0 (others):** $56,308  

---

### 🧾 Key Findings  
- **Households with less privacy (H8 = 1) → lower average income**  
- **Disparity particularly strong among Asian demographic**  
- **Household privacy choices are linked with broader financial inequalities**
